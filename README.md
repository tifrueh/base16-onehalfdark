# base16-onehalfdark

This repository includes two color definition files with the colors of the
[onehalfdark](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf) color scheme. They are intended
to be used with Linux's the `setvtrgb` utility to set the virtual terminal
colors.

To apply these colors early on in the boot process,
[base16-vtrgb](https://github.com/coderonline/base16-vtrgb) can be used.
